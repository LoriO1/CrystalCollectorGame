# CrystalCollectorGame

look at the magic number above the crystals. you are trying to get your points to match that number without being greater than that number.

click each of the elements of harmony crystals to find out the number value of each one. it will be very important for you to remember the value of each crystal.

the more times you click the crystals, the more points you collect. your updated "total" will continue to add up each time you click a crystal. keep an eye on the Total. It will help remind you of the value for each crystal, which will help you meet the magic number.

when the number of points you collect is the same exact number as the magic number, you win a magic crystal. but if you go over the magic number, you will have to try again in the next round.

the Crystal Collection pane will help you keep track of magic won and lost.

good luck!
